## Webserver
This is the webserver files for the D&D encounter simulator. It is hosted on openshift [where you set your team to battle dragons and tarrasques](dnd.matteoferla.com).
It actually was my first go with Pyramid on Openshift. I used someone else's framework —which I do not have listed, so I cannot credit— and it is very messy.

If you were looking for the python module to similate locally all the encouner you fancy, then you need to check out the [DnD encounter similator  GitHub repository](https://github.com/matteoferla/DnD-battler).
